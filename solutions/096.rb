#  <p>Su Doku (Japanese meaning <i>number place</i>) is the name given to a popular
#  puzzle concept. Its origin is unclear, but credit must be attributed to Leonhar
# d Euler who invented a similar, and much more difficult, puzzle idea called Lati
# n Squares. The objective of Su Doku puzzles, however, is to replace the blanks (
# or zeros) in a 9 by 9 grid in such that each row, column, and 3 by 3 box contain
# s each of the digits 1 to 9. Below is an example of a typical starting puzzle gr
# id and its solution grid.</p>

# <p>A well constructed Su Doku puzzle has a unique solution and can be solved by
# logic, although it may be necessary to employ "guess and test" methods in order
# to eliminate options (there is much contested opinion over this). The complexity
#  of the search determines the difficulty of the puzzle; the example above is con
# sidered <i>easy</i> because it can be solved by straight forward direct deductio
# n.</p>
# <p>The 6K text file, <a href="project/resources/p096_sudoku.txt">sudoku.txt</a>
# (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'), contains fifty different Su Doku puz
# zles ranging in difficulty, but all with unique solutions (the first puzzle in t
# he file is the example above).</p>
# <p>By solving all fifty puzzles find the sum of the 3-digit numbers found in the
#  top left corner of each solution grid; for example, 483 is the 3-digit number f
# ound in the top left corner of the solution grid above.</p>
