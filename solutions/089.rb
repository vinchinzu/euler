#  <p>For a number written in Roman numerals to be considered valid there are basic
#  rules which must be followed. Even though the rules allow some numbers to be ex
# pressed in more than one way there is always a "best" way of writing a particula
# r number.</p>
# <p>For example, it would appear that there are at least six ways of writing the
# number sixteen:</p>
# <p class="margin_left monospace">IIIIIIIIIIIIIIII<br>
# VIIIIIIIIIII<br>
# VVIIIIII<br>
# XIIIIII<br>
# VVVI<br>
# XVI</p>
# <p>However, according to the rules only <span class="monospace">XIIIIII</span> a
# nd <span class="monospace">XVI</span> are valid, and the last example is conside
# red to be the most efficient, as it uses the least number of numerals.</p>
# <p>The 11K text file, <a href="resources/documents/0089_roman.txt">roman.txt</a>
