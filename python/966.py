# Project Euler Problem 966
#
# PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
# Let $I(a, b, c)$ be the largest possible area of intersection between a triangle of side lengths $a, b, c$ and a circle which has the same area as the triangle.
# For example $I(3, 4, 5) \approx 4.593049$ and $I(3, 4, 6) \approx 3.552564$.
# Find the sum of $I(a, b, c)$ for integers $a, b, c$ such that $1 \le a \le b \le c \lt a + b$ and $a + b + c \le 200$.
# Give your answer rounded to two digits after the decimal point.
#
# PYTHON IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
# - Solve the problem described above
# - Implement solve() function
#
